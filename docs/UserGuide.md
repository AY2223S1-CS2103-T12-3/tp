HobbyList is a **desktop app for managing hobby activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HobbyList can get your activity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/42km run`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/42km run t/sport` or as `n/42km run`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/sport`, `t/sport t/cardio` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `d/NUS Run d/NUS Biathlon`, only `d/NUS Biathlon` will be taken.

* The date format for `[date/DATE]` should be `yyyy-mm-dd`. e.g. `date/2022-12-25`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
